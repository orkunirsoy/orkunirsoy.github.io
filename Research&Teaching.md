# Research & Professional Development

## Current Research

I am currently working with [Prof. Osman Yağan](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~oyagan/) at Carnegie Mellon University on research projects in network science, combining both theoretical and applied approaches.

### Primary Research Areas
- **Cascading Failures in Social Networks**: Investigating failure propagation mechanisms in complex social systems and developing ML models for early detection and mitigation strategies
- **Early Indicators of Offline Violence**: Analyzing online conspiracy theories to predict offline violent events and developing computational methods for early warning systems

### Research Methodology
My research combines:
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning, predictive modeling, and pattern recognition
- **Network Science**: Social network analysis, graph theory, and network dynamics
- **Simulation Modeling**: Agent-based modeling and system dynamics
- **Data Science**: Large-scale data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling
