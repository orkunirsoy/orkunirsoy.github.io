## Hello,
I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in AI/ML applications for complex systems analysis. I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Industrial Engineering from Boğaziçi University in Turkey.

My research focuses on applying machine learning and network science to address social challenges, including polarization, misinformation, and opinion dynamics. I work on topics such as cascading failures, multi-topic opinion diffusion on social networks, and early indicators of offline violence in online conspiracy theories under the guidance of Prof. Osman Yağan.

I am currently seeking summer internship opportunities in AI/ML, data science, and software engineering roles where I can apply my research skills to real-world problems. My technical expertise spans Python, machine learning frameworks, network analysis, and simulation modeling.

Please feel free to explore my research, projects, and publications using the navigation above. I welcome inquiries about potential collaborations or internship opportunities.

Orkun.
