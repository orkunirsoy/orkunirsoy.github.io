## Hello,
I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Network Science and AI/ML applications for network analysis. I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Industrial Engineering from Boğaziçi University in Turkey.

My research focuses on application of network science in engineering systems and utilizing applied data science/ML to analyze social networks. I work on topics such as overload based cascading failures and early indicators of violence in online communities under the guidance of Prof. Osman Yağan.

I am currently seeking summer internship opportunities in AI/ML, data science and network science roles where I can apply my research skills to real-world problems. My technical expertise spans Python, machine learning frameworks, network analysis, and simulation modeling.

Please feel free to explore my research, projects, and publications using the navigation above. I welcome inquiries about potential collaborations or internship opportunities.

Orkun.
